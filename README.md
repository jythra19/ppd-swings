### Project Description
Our project is a web-based platform designed to support women experiencing postpartum depression (PPD) by analyzing their mood patterns and providing personalized mental health resources. Users can log their emotions, track mood swings, and receive coping strategies. Partners can create accounts to access insights into their loved one‚Äôs mental health status and receive tailored guidance on how to provide emotional and practical support. The platform includes educational content, interactive tools, and professional resources to foster understanding and strengthen relationships during the postpartum period. Built with HTML, CSS, and javascript, the website ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience for both patients and their partners.




### The Problem statement
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mental health condition affecting many new mothers, often going undiagnosed due to stigma, lack of awareness, and limited support systems. Partners and family members may struggle to understand and provide the necessary emotional and practical support. There is a need for a digital solution that allows postpartum women to track their mood patterns, receive personalized coping strategies, and enable their partners to access insights and guidelines to offer effective support. Our web-based platform aims to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly system that facilitates emotional well-being, enhances partner involvement, and promotes awareness of PPD through data-driven guidance.




### The Solution
Our project provides a web-based support platform for postpartum depression (PPD) that allows mothers to track their mood swings, access personalized mental health resources, and receive coping strategies. The system enables partners to log in, view insights about their loved one‚Äôs emotional well-being, and access guidelines on how to provide support. By combining mood analysis, educational content, and interactive tools, the platform fosters better understanding, communication, and emotional support between partners. Built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, this solution offers a user-friendly and accessible way to address postpartum depression and improve mental well-being for affected women and their families.
